# Spell-Checker-Word-Editor
This code implements a simple spell checker using a Trie data structure. It begins by defining a TrieNode struct and associated functions to create nodes, insert words, and search for words within the Trie. The main function initializes a Trie and populates it with words from a "dictionary.txt" file. The user is then prompted to enter sentences for spell checking. Each word in the sentence is checked against the Trie; if a word is misspelled, the user is asked to provide the correct spelling. The program displays both the original and corrected sentences and tracks the number of mistakes. This process repeats until the user decides to stop. Finally, the Trie is deallocated, and the program terminates.
